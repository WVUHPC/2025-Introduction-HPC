## Introduction

The concept of "supercomputing" refers to the use of powerful computational machines for the purpose of processing massively and complex data or conduct large numerical or symbolic problems using the concentrated computational resources.
In many cases supercomputers are build from multiple computer systems that are meant to work togheter in parallel. 
Supercomputing involves a system working at the maximum potential and whose performance is larger of a normal computer. 

Sample use cases include weather, energy, life sciences, and manufacturing.

## Concepts

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- "Supercomputers are far more powerful than desktop computers"

- "Most supercomputers today are HPC clusters"

- "Supercomputers are intended to run large calculations or simulations that takes days or weeks to complete"

- "HPC clusters are aggregates of machines that operate as a single entity to provide computational power to many users"
